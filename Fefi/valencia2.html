			<h1>What Happened?</h1>
			<h2>The storms concentrated over the Magro and Turia river basins and, in the Poyo riverbed, produced walls of water that overflowed riverbanks, catching people unaware as they went on with their daily lives on Tuesday evening and early Wednesday.
In the blink of an eye, the muddy water covered roads and railways, and entered houses and businesses in towns and villages on the southern outskirts of Valencia city.
 Drivers had to take shelter on car roofs, while residents took refuge on higher ground.
Spain’s national weather service said that in the hard-hit locality of Chiva, it rained more in eight hours than it had in the preceding 20 months, calling the deluge “extraordinary.”
 Other areas on the southern outskirts of Valencia city didn't get rain before they were wiped out by the wall of water that overflowed the drainage canals.
When authorities sent alerts to mobile phones warning of the seriousness of the flooding and asking people to stay at home, many were already on the road, working or covered in water in low-lying areas or underground garages, which became death traps.
 But in an area between Utiel and Chiva, in the province of Valencia, rainfall exceeded 300 litres per square metre. 
 In that area, storm systems formed and regenerated continuously,
Meteorologists said a year's worth of rain had fallen in eight hours in parts of Valencia on Oct. 29.</h2></td>

	<td><h1>What Is The Reconstruction Plan?</h1><h2>The European Commission has urged Spain to begin necessary reconstruction work following the DANA (a severe weather event). Spanish government sources confirmed they are exploring options, including requesting a modification of the recovery and resilience plan, which could redirect part of the anti-crisis fund to help with the reconstruction of affected areas. This approach has been used by other countries, such as Croatia, Slovenia, and Greece, in response to natural disasters.

However, the Commission noted that modifying the plan could take time, as it requires a three-month process: two months for evaluation by the Commission and one month for approval by the EU member states. The Commission's spokesperson, Veerle Nuyts, emphasized that the recovery plan is just one possible funding source, and the Spanish authorities have not yet formally requested a modification, though they are in contact with the Commission about available support. She also stated that eligible measures could be reimbursed retroactively, encouraging Spain to start the necessary investments soon.</h2></td>
